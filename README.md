Short Story:
*) I wanted to use iScroll with jQuery Mobile and needed to replace an existing pull-to-refresh utility
*) iScroll4 had a pull-to-refresh option as well as a widget compatible with jQuery Mobile in another GitHub repo
*) Folks over here: https://github.com/watusi/jquery-mobile-iscrollview/issues/118 was looking for an iScroll 5 implementation - no one had done it yet aside from some jsFiddle examples
*) Folks over here: https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll/issues/378 were looking for a pull-to-refresh implementation with iScroll 5
*) I combined sources from both places and specifically inspiration from https://github.com/orenagiv and http://pnc.co.il/dev/iscroll-5-pull-to-refresh-and-infinite-demo.html to put together what I have in this repo

Going Forward:
*) Please submit PR's as I plan to be actively engaged in maintaining this since I have a personal stake in its success.
*) Let me know of your problems but PLEASE create a jsFiddle or host a site somewhere to reproduce your issue.
*) Enjoy the fruits of some significant labor. :-)
